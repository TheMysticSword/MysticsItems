# Changelog
#### 2.1.5:
* Vendetta:
	* Buff Duration: ~~16s (+16s per stack)~~ ⇒ 16s (+4s per stack)
	* Buff duration on enemies can now be configured (by default: 0.5s (+0.125s per stack))
* Choc Chip config now has an Ignored Buff Names option that you can use to select which buffs Choc Chip should not affect
	* By default, it ignores:
		* Medkit delayed heal, because it's technically counted as a buff, so Choc Chip would *extend* it instead of shortening
		* Invincibility, because extending it makes Merc too powerful
		* All of the Void Fog debuffs, because they are counted as buffs, and therefore would get extended
* Cup of Expresso buffs are no longer removed when all stacks of the item are gone
* Treasure Map zone now has a minimum radius of 2.25m to prevent it from being unusable with Focused Convergence stacks
* Fixed Black Monolith little monoliths around shrines disappearing when the shrines are used up
* Fixed Keep Up The Rhythm challenge counting as complete when reaching Void Fields
* Fixed Marwan's Light burn stacking damage on each hit
